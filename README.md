# Google DA Capstone Project 1: Cyclistic Bike Share Marketing Analysis

## Executive Summary
Using Excel, SQL and Tableau, I pulled bike rental records from the database and created a dashboard to compare the different the rental habits between two customer groups: members and annual. After uncovering the main differences between the two user groups, I recommend the marketing department the focus areas for their marketing strategies:
  1. aa
  2. aa
  3. ss

## Business Problem:
Cyclistic company would like to convert more of their casual users into members in effort to increase revenue. The marketing department would like to formulate new marketing strategies, but they lack insights on what makes for effective marketing.

## Methodology

1. Download dataset (in CSV) from Divvy database.
2. SQL query that cleans, transforms and combines data from the the CSV files.
3. Build a dashboard using Tableau that visualises the different ways casuals/members use th bikeshare service.
