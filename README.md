# Cyclistic Bike Share January 24 Analysis

## Background
This is the second option for capstone project from Google DA certifications I completed last year. I decided to revisit the course and complete this optional project to add to my portfolio.

## Executive Summary
Using Excel and Tableau, I pulled bike rental records from the database and created a dashboard to compare the different the rental habits between two customer groups: members and annual. After uncovering the main differences between the two user groups, I recommend the marketing department the focus areas for their marketing strategies.

## Business Problem:
Cyclistic bikes would like to convert more of their casual users into members in effort to increase revenue. The marketing department would like to formulate new marketing strategies, but they lack insights on what makes for effective marketing.

## Methodology

1. Complete business statement sheet.
2. Download dataset (in CSV) from Divvy database.
3. Use Excel to clean, transform and sort dataset.
4. Build a dashboard using Tableau that visualises the different ways casuals/members use the bikeshare service.

## Skills 

Excel: data cleaning, manipulation, organisation, filtering

Tableau: data modelling, calculated fields

## Results and business recommendation:

### Insights gained in January
1. 24k casual users versus 120k annual members.
2. Casual user rentals peaked at 4pm, 5pm and 7am.
3. Casual user rentals are most popular at the beginning and end of month. Least popular in the middle of the month.
4. Casual users showed tendency to start and end their rentals from stations surrounding Ellis Ave.

### Recommendations
1. Provide special rate/package for peak hours. It seems like casual users use rental to commute to work. A "work commute" package may appeal enough casual users to sign up as annnual members.
2. Increase service at peak stations near Ellis Ave.
